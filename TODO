* Take message storage out of the match path.
  This is currently in here because it's the easiest way to do it, but it's
  blocking match processing on DB writes unnecessarily.  I need to come up with
  a consistent computed key (e.g. md5(source + msg)) and enqueue storage jobs
  at a low priority with these keys.

* Build some kind of web frontend (merb?) that will serve up RSS.
  * Allow track management?

* Add caching to matcher.
  It loads the whole match DB on every hit just in case it changed.  

* Add caching to user lookups (by id and jid).
  These are both done quite a bit.  No need to hit the DB all the time.
